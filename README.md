# To Do List Project

This is a simple To Do List application built using Node.js, Express, and EJS. The application allows users to add, view, and manage their daily tasks. The project is designed to help you understand the basics of web development, including server-side scripting, templating, and styling.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the list.
- View all tasks in a list format.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Responsive design with custom styles.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **EJS**: Embedded JavaScript templating.
- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets for styling the application.

**What I Learned**
Through this project, I learned the following:

**Setting Up a Node.js Project:** I learned how to initialize a Node.js project, manage dependencies using npm, and create a basic server using Express.

**Routing in Express:** I understood how to set up routes in Express to handle different HTTP requests and serve different pages.

**Templating with EJS:** I learned how to use EJS to create dynamic HTML pages. This includes passing data from the server to the template and rendering it on the client side.

**Styling with CSS:** I practiced writing CSS to style the application, making it visually appealing and responsive.

**Handling Form Submissions:** I learned how to handle form submissions in Express, process the input data, and update the view accordingly.

**Using Middleware:** I understood the concept of middleware in Express and how to use it to serve static files and handle other tasks.

**Debugging and Troubleshooting:** I gained experience in debugging and troubleshooting common issues that arise during web development, such as layout problems and server errors.

**Future Improvements**
Add Database Integration: Integrate a database (e.g., MongoDB) to persist tasks across sessions.
User Authentication: Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to manage their own tasks.
Task Categories: Add the ability to categorize tasks and filter them based on categories.
Due Dates and Reminders: Add functionality to set due dates for tasks and send reminders.


This project was a great learning experience, providing hands-on practice with Node.js, Express, and EJS. It helped me understand the fundamentals of web development and build a functional web application from scratch.
